                            <p>In React apps, there are at least seven ways to handle the state. Let us briefly explore a few of them in this part.<br />
                                Web Storage,Local State,Lifted State,URL.

                        <div className="px-4 pb-4">
                            <p>The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.</p>

                        <div className="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
                            <p>The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.</p>

                        <div className="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
                            <p>It's easier to learn Vue than angular and it reasonably takes the same amount of time and effort as learning react. Although some people argue that it's even easier to learn than react but that's of course subjective and varies from person to person.</p>
